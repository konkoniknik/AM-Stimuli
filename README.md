# AM-Stimuli
Some Proof-of-Concept code for AM stimuli generation on MNIST (JAIR 2021, Volume 72, "Learning Realistic Patterns from Visually Unrealistic Stimuli: Generalization and Data Anonymization", https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10007).  We extract information from a Teacher network in the form of a stimuli dataset, and  we then train a student network with this dataset.
